			<h2>The Project</h2>
			<div class="c2_area"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/67638094" width="810" height="456" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div >
			
			
			<p class="c2_area"><i>Download the <a target="_blank" href="files/VOICES_brochure.pdf">VOICES brochure</a>and the <a target="_blank" href="files/VOICES_at_a_glance.pdf">VOICES leaflet</a></i></p>

			<p class="c2_area">The VOICES consultation process gathered opinions and ideas about urban waste from citizens across the EU. It used science centres and museums as powerful spaces for public engagement. The results were fed back to policymakers in order to influence the direction of EU research policy.</p>
			<p class="c2_area">VOICES answers the Science in Society 2013.1.2.1-1 call on citizen participation in science and technology policy.</p>
			<h3>Why VOICES?</h3>
			<p class="c2_area">At the heart of the VOICES project is the idea of Responsible Research and Innovation (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/document_library/pdf_06/options-for-strengthening_en.pdf" target="_blank">RRI</a>). This means that while designing the research and innovation process, we have to consider ethical aspects and the needs of citizens. Research should be ready to adjust its shape to ensure it fits society's requirements.</p>
			<h3>How can I use VOICES?</h3>
			<p class="c2_area">The results of the VOICES consultation directly affected the European Commission's <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/horizon2020/index_en.cfm" target="_blank">Horizon 2020</a> calls for research funding. As such, VOICES is a model for incorporating citizens' voices into RRI. But the project outcomes can also be used by other stakeholders on a local and national, as well as European level, for example:
			<ul class="c2_area">
			<li><b>Industry</b> can make use of the results to look into gaps in the market for new innovations;</li>
			<li><b>Researchers</b> can use VOICES results to align their research with the principles of RRI;</li>
			<li><b>Educators</b> can use project outcomes to give a national and European perspective to classroom discussions on current science topics;</li>
			<li><b>Universities</b> can use VOICES as a model for citizen participation;</li>
			<li><b>Policymakers and funding agencies</b> both within and beyond the European institutions can shape their research strategy to fit RRI.</li>
			</ul>

			</p>
			<h3>VOICES in numbers</h3>
			<p class="c2_area">
				<ul class="c2_area">
					<li>1.270.000 words translated</li>
					<li>1.000 European citizens</li>
					<li>557 EU municipalities</li>
					<li>350 ideas</li>
					<li>300 hours of consultation</li>
					<li>100 focus groups</li>
					<li>33 locations</li>
					<li>27 EU countries</li>
					<li>22 external experts</li>
					<li>8 research directions</li>
				</ul>

<h2>VOICES methodology</h2>
			<p class="c2_area">
VOICES consulted citizens using a renowned method - focus groups - in a unique way:
<ul  class="c2_area">
<li>Diversity: never before had focus groups in all 27 EU member states been used to influence EU policy, with citizens selected from a representative range of backgrounds</li>
<li>Structure: the VOICES focus groups are composed of four exercises, which engage the participants on the relevant topics, drawing out collective opinions and ideas in a carefully facilitated face-to-face process.</li>
<li>Flexibility: the VOICES methodology can be adapted for use at national and local levels, and with a range of policy topics.</li>
</ul>
</p>
			<p class="c2_area">
The VOICES focus groups lasted 3 hours, with 10 participants in each, and were led by trained moderators following a semi-structured script, completed by an introduction and evaluation. The four exercises consisted of: drawing household waste streams; identifying barriers and concerns related to waste management issues; elaborating solutions and ideas for achieving a "zero waste society"; and attributing priority to the group's ideas.

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
			<p class="c2_area">
VOICES took as its subject matter the topic of urban waste as a resource, and
the concept of a "zero waste society".</p>
			<p class="c2_area">
Fitting with the aims of RRI, key findings of the project can be grouped into two
key categories.</p>
			<ol class="c2_area">
<li>VOICES validates the EU's current priorities of research and
policies on urban waste
<ul>
<li>Citizens want less packaging, and more efficient packaging materials.
They want to see 100% biodegradable packaging, and plastics that can
be fully recycled without loss of quality.</li>
<li>They want it to be easier to recycle and reuse products.</li>
<li>They want manufacturers to be regulated more heavily, taking
responsibility for the lifespan and recycling of their products, and ending
planned obsolescence.</li>
<li>More recycling points are needed at convenient locations.</li>
<li>They want incineration plants to be used as much as possible to
produce heat and energy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>VOICES also proposes new ways to strengthen current research<ul>
<li>European citizens feel convenience in the household is crucial. This is a
part of waste management often neglected by research. There is a clear
need for devices to facilitate sorting and compacting in the home ("smart
bins"), or technology which allows waste to be used as a resource in the
household.</li>
<li>Citizens want to feel the benefit of waste separation. This can be done
by making incentives, deposit systems and reward schemes more
widespread.</li>
<li>Education and communication are crucial. Citizens are largely unaware
of what happens to their waste, and would feel more engaged in the
process if knowledge was more widespread.</li>
<li>Technology can be a motivation to recycle in itself. Citizens feel that
systems using chips, electronic tags and apps can help to empower
people in the recycling process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
